== Next Step will be the crm2ldap program ==
* Move out of SugarForge unstable CVS server, to GitHub quite certainly
* rename project to crm2ldap
* rewrite in better python, use toutpt exemple as base of 'good python'
* detect absence of ldapsync column before deleting it on sql queries
* remove usage of sql files to get variables inside (db name, db prefix)
* use a central configuration file (avoid database redefinition in all scripts)
* provide openLDAP ACL example on the contact
* provide user_rights commands for security of stored configuration data (openLDAP/MYSQL access)
* provide default generic linux PATH for the scripts
* merge sugarLDAPManageSyncUsers et sugarLDAPManageSync, the first one should be only an option in the second one
* integrate CiviCRM contrib scripts, in a more centralized version
* transform the script+cron mechanism into a daemon with forked children.
