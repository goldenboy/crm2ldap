* Why not using MySQL as a backend for OpenLDAP?
------------------------------------------------
We tried it. It's awfully slow. The primary goal of an LDAP server is to provide a fast-read access, something realy faster than 
a relationnal database read access. Using a relationnal database as a backend seems a bad idea. But there's worst. MySQL is not
an object-database, most LDAP queries requires object inheritance checks, and this generates a very very big number of queries 
in openLDAP-mysql backend implementations.

* Why we should restrict write access on the OpenLDAP branch storing contacts infos?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because on every modification of the contact or the account related to this contact in SugarCRM the contact will be re-created
by the sync scripts. And anything not stored in MySQL sugar database will be lost.

* Have you tried it with Active Directory?
------------------------------------------
No. But why not, if you do so tell us.

* Have you tried it with Oracle backend?
----------------------------------------
No. But you can test it. You'll certainly have to re-do the triggers in an Oracle way. Then some queries may be re-done as well,
like group by queries in --report options fo the manager script.

* Why this **** fields isn't available on Outlook/Thunderbird version xxxx?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outlook and Thunderbird doesn't provides LDAP mapping configuration. You'll have to find out what attribute they want and adjust
the mapping in the synchro script. If your OpenLDAP doesnt provides the required attribute see extension.schema and add you own
attribute there.
And please report your findings, let's make it available for next users.

* Reading ldap_sync columns values in MySQL, what does the ints means?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ldap_sync status is:
	0: not initialized : this field was reset via reset.sql or as yet never been recorded in LDAP
	1: sync : OK, this field is normally in the same state in LDAP (if he should be there)
	2: sync started : sync is actually running on this field, or as stopped before the end, the --force option of sync script can recheck that row
	3: not sync anymore : field has been updated in MySQL and not yet in LDAP, it will comme soon

* I have made some big data manipulations (backup recovery, LDAP branch deleted, strange things) and now I'm not sure anymore of the sync state, what should I do?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Restart the whole process, for that:
- delete the LDAP branch where synchronised contacts and/or synchrosnised users are stored. Well do not delete the ou, but remove all records in the branch.
- run the sql/reset.sql script on the sugarcrm MySQL database
- now you can wait for your crontab syncs to redo the job step by step, or you can run it manually for a first big synchro with a big -l parameter (for example
you can have a database of 10 000 contacts, containing 50 000 rows -- 40 000 marked deleted --, doing the sync at 100 each minute can be quite long). Try to launch manually
some silent synchronisation of 1000 lines:
nice -n -15 /opt/sugar-ldap-sync/sugarLDAPManageSync.py -s -l 1000 /opt/sugar-ldap-sync
