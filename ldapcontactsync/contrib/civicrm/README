There is a doc subdirectory where you can find some usefull infos on ldap

There is documentation on Sugar-Ldap-Contact-Sync program that apply mostlyto this civicrm port.
The job is the same, the install process is the same. Please read instructions from there (parent directories)

Differences between CiviCRM sync and SugarCRM sync:
===================================================
* table structure is not the same :-)
* User Sync: drupal user synchronisation cannot be based only on update-ldap_sync_status-with-triggers, as drupal really
removes the user row. So we add a deleted_suer table updated on delete trigger to track users that should be deleted
in LDAP. Once the deletion is done on Drupal this table is cleanup up.
* User Sync: Drupal6 does not store the md5 password in a hashed form, so we must apply some unhexify and base64encode stuff to get the godd
password in LDAP.
* Contact Sync: custom fields are not handled yet

The final Crontab can be:
